        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p> strong personal connection to the hardships encountered by gardeners and domestic workers gave rise to Empowering the Nation. The program, which was started in 2018 by Precious Radebe, aims to improve people from underprivileged backgrounds by giving them employable skills.
         Motivated by her parents and older family members who were never able to complete formal schooling, Precious decided to establish a place where people could overcome comparable obstacles and realise their full potential.
